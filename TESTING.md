Testing potion functionality:

The potion tests are built to work when run all at once or separately except for the testUsed() test case.
This test case keeps track of all previous actions of the class, and thus will be accurate when only when run with the other tests.
If you wish to perform only the unit test for the used function, you may reenable the testUsedAlone test and run all tests, or only the testUsedAlone test.
